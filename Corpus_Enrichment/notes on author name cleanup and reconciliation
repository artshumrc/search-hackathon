What we tried
=============

In Openrefine:

1. Clustering
2. 
3. Wikidata recon for instances of class Q5 ("Human")
4. TO DO: Extract IDs:
If you get a chance to do this, here's how:
Create a new column from the reconciled author name column ('Edit column->Add column based on this column…’)
Name it 'Wikidata URI'
In the GREL expression box type cell.recon.match.id
This will result in a column of full URIs, including Wikidata IDs
If you want to isolate the IDs ('Q' + number), create yet another column ('Edit column->Add column based on this column…’) and try out some GREL expressions to transform the text: https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GREL-String-Functions

In Python:
1. 

In SPARQL:
1.
