Planning materials, samples, assets, instructions, and code created for and during "Harvard Library Hackathon: A Concept Search Engine for Literature and the Humanities"

## React and Express
Not sure if this was the right way to go, so feel free to discard, but I stubbed out a React and Express app using this [tutorial](https://www.javascriptstuff.com/build-your-own-starter/#0-intro). It does next to nothing that we want(yet), so feel free to go crazy.

To do anything with this app, please navigate to the Darian folder, and run these commands.

Usage
---
 
Start the development server with this command:
 
```
npm start
```

It is currently set to start the server at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). This default port can (and should) be changed from `./Darian/server.js`
 
 
 
Setup
---
 
```
npm install
```
 
 
 
Compile
---
 
```
npm run compile
```
